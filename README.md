## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In this project, our goal is to analyze the data gathered from New York Stck Exchange regarding various stock names and their respective change in share prices. This will allow us to visualize their performance and draw trends over the time period (2010-2016). Our shared interest in the Stock market in general, alongside the recent surge in information about stock market fluctuations made us inclined towards thorough data analysis on the topic. Further, we will be looking to get the following questions answered -
1. How different stocks performed over the years at NYSE? - This will be answered using a visualization of all stock prices over the years and analyzing them side by side.
1. How did weekly data be used to predict future performance? - Weekly data and Monthly data graphs can be used to draw trends over longer time frames and can also help us understand and predict the future perfromance of the stock.
1. How did other aspects of the market fluctuate prices? - Changes in accounts available float among others, can effect the stock market pricing severely.
In the end, this data will be available for visualization using user-friendly dashboards.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The given dataset contains 4 subsets each containing critical information on the stock price and other related factors -
1. Fundamental market information including account and cash ratios
1. Stock price at the opena and close for each day
1. Price and volume data
1. Securities filing with SEC and related data

The data has been obtained from NYSE public information repository and is readily available to everyone given all the companies listed are publically traded stocks at NYSE. This also helps in alalyzing given the data can be cross verified with company data as well as through Third party websites such as Yahoo Finance etc.
Given the public nature of this data, it is intended for all investors as well as financial intitutions looking to gain from the change in stock prices. The data from NYSE has been collected over the period of 2010-2016 using automated trading systems as well as the traders working at the NYSE alongside online brokerages.
